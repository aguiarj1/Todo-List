# Todo list app
A todo list command-line app written in Java. 

## Description: 
This application keeps track of todo items, and displays 
all the todo items in a list format. You can easily add
new items and remove items from the list when done. It 
saves the todo items and loads them when you start the 
program again. 

## Why this project exists:
I wanted an easy-to-use todo application for my own use.
I'm also planning to add more features that are specific
to my own needs, and specific to how I like to organize
my tasks. 

## Additional modifications or features I plan to make: 
* add a project componenet where I can associate any 
todo item with a project. 
* have the todo list appear in order by due date. 

## How to run it: 
compile all the java files. For example: 
`javac *.java`
run the program 
`java TodoView`

to add a todo item:
`add this is a description of a todo item 6/7/2018`

to view todo items type: 
`view`

to remove a todo item type: 
`done 1`
where 1 represents the todo item id. 

to exit program type: 
`quit`
